# AffineCipher - Decryption
Implementation of decrypting a text that was encrypted using affine cypher. The text is in romanian so we use a frequency analysis for the most used characters from a plain text, we also study the encrypted text to see the most used characters. In plain text case the most used characters are ' ' and 'a', and for the encrypted text is 'T' and '.'.
